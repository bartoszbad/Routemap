# Routemap

   What does it do? 
        Routemap is a Web-App, which stores info about interesting routes and photo-spots.
   As anonymous user, you can browse both of them. After login in you are able to add your own routes and photo spots.
   You can also create "playlists" with routes of your choice.

   What technologies are used? 
        Python, Django, JavaScript.

   What are the goals of the project?
        The project was prepared as a final project for Python Developer Course. The idea of the project was born based on my hobby - automotive. The main reason is to allow users to browse and share lists of routes.  

   What is the stage of the project?
        Main functions are implemented (browsing and sharing lists of routes & photo spots) - 1st stage.
        Functionality will be extended soon, e.g. remove options, share your route list, manage your account, administration dashboard
        The app is planned to be set on an online server.
